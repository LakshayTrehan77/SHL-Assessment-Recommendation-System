# SHL Assessment Recommendation System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered recommendation system designed to analyze job descriptions or candidate profiles and suggest relevant SHL assessments. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), embeddings, and a ChromaDB vector database, it provides accurate, context-aware test recommendations to streamline the assessment selection process.

## âœ¨ Features

- **RAG-Powered Recommendations**: Combines retrieval of relevant assessment data with generative AI for context-aware outputs.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports text-based job descriptions or candidate profiles, with potential URL input support.
- **Structured Output**: Delivers detailed assessment recommendations, including name, URL, duration, and type.
- **SHL Catalog Integration**: Connects with an SHL assessment catalog stored in ChromaDB for up-to-date recommendations.
- **Debug Mode**: Offers transparency into the retrieval and generation process when enabled.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures reliable and consistent recommendation outputs.

## ðŸš€ Usage

The project offers two ways to interact with the system:

### Option 1: Launch the Streamlit App
Run the Streamlit-based user interface:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
- Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
- Input a job description or candidate profile and view recommended SHL assessments.

### Option 2: Start the FastAPI Server
Run the RESTful API server:
```bash
uvicorn api_app:app --reload
```
- Access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Use tools like `curl` or Postman to query the system programmatically.

## ðŸ§  Approach

The SHL Assessment Recommendation System uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate recommendations:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Accepts job descriptions or candidate profiles via text input or URL (if supported).
   - Preprocesses the text to clean and standardize it for embedding generation.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Converts input text into embeddings using pre-trained models.
   - Stores SHL assessment catalog data as embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.

3. **Retrieval**:
   - Queries the ChromaDB vector database to retrieve the most relevant assessment entries based on similarity between input embeddings and stored embeddings.
   - Returns top-matching assessment metadata (e.g., name, URL, duration).

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Feeds retrieved assessment data into a generative AI model (via Gemini API or similar) to produce context-aware, natural language recommendations.
   - Combines factual retrieval with generative output for improved accuracy and coherence.

5. **Output Delivery**:
   - Presents recommendations in a structured format (e.g., JSON or UI display).
   - Optionally includes debug information to explain the retrieval and generation process.
